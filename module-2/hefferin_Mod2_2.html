        <h2>Introduction to Chelsea</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">I grew up in a small town nestled in the heart of North Carolina. This quaint place is known for its friendly community and beautiful landscapes. Living there shaped my childhood in many positive ways.</p>
        
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy a variety of hobbies. One of my passions is painting, which allows me to express my creativity. Additionally, I love hiking and exploring nature trails.</p>
        
        <p>Family plays a significant role in my life. We often gather for holidays and special occasions, creating lasting memories. Their support has been invaluable as I pursue my education.</p>
        
        <p>I am also a big fan of technology. <span class="sentence">Learning about new advancements excites me and fuels my desire to innovate.</span> This interest has guided my academic path toward web development.</p>
